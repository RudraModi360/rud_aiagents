# Python Agent Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains a versatile and extensible **Python Agent** framework. Initially designed for simple command-line operations, it has evolved to include a separate backend service, voice capabilities, persistent memory, and a more complex tool management system. The structure is modular, separating command definitions, core agent logic, backend services, tool integrations, and utility settings.


## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories and files, each serving a specific purpose in the overall functionality of the Python Agent framework.

## Brief Description of Each Component

| Path                      | Purpose                                                                                             |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main.py`                 | The main entry point for starting the interactive CLI agent.                                        |
| `mcp_tools.json`          | A JSON file defining the tools available to the `agent_mcp`, allowing for dynamic tool loading.     |
| `backend/`                | A self-contained backend service, likely an API, that runs its own agent instance.                  |
| `commands/`               | Manages the creation, registration, and execution of user-facing commands in the CLI.               |
| `core/agent.py`           | The primary `Agent` class that orchestrates command execution, tool usage, and state management.    |
| `core/agent_mcp.py`       | An alternative `Agent` class, likely for more complex, multi-step reasoning tasks.                  |
| `core/cli.py` / `cli_mcp.py`| Manages the user interaction loop for the respective agent, handling input and displaying output.   |
| `core/memory.py`          | **NEW**: Intelligent context management with automatic summarization, reducing token usage by ~70%. |
| `core/narrator.py`        | Provides descriptive outputs or potentially integrates with voice systems.                          |
| `tools/`                  | Contains the schemas and implementations for the various tools the agent can use (e.g., file I/O).  |
| `utils/`                  | A collection of shared helper functions and configuration loaders.                                  |
| `voice/`                  | Contains scripts for voice output, enabling the agent to speak its responses.                       |

## Tools and Extensibility

The agent's capabilities are extended through a robust tool system. Tools are defined in `tools/` and their availability can be configured via `mcp_tools.json`. This allows for different agent instances (e.g., `agent.py` vs. `agent_mcp.py`) to have different sets of capabilities.

### Adding New Tools
1.  **Implement the Tool:** Create the tool's function in `tools/tools.py` or a new module within `tools/`.
2.  **Define the Schema:** Create a Pydantic model in `tools/tool_schemas.py` to define the tool's input parameters.
3.  **Register the Tool:** If using `mcp_tools.json`, add a new entry describing the tool, its purpose, and its parameters.

## New Features

### ðŸš€ Context Management (v1.0)

The agent now includes intelligent context management that automatically reduces token usage by ~70% while maintaining conversation quality:

- **Automatic Summarization**: Old messages are compressed when approaching token limits
- **Token Estimation**: Accurate counting using tiktoken (with heuristic fallback)
- **Recent Context Preservation**: Always keeps recent messages intact for continuity
- **Backwards Compatible**: Existing code works without changes

See [docs/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md](docs/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md) for detailed documentation.

**Quick Start:**
```python
from core.agent_mcp import MCPAgent

# Create agent with context management
agent = MCPAgent(
    max_context_tokens=6000,
    memory_summarization_threshold=0.75
)

# Use normally - context is managed automatically
await agent.chat(sessions, "Your message")

# Check memory stats
stats = agent.memory.get_stats()
print(f"Using {stats['total_tokens']} tokens ({stats['utilization']})")
```
